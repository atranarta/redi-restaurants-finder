# Restaurants Finder

This is the final project for our React JS course at [ReDi School (Berlin)](https://www.redi-school.org/berlin).
We have deployed it here: [Restaurants Finder](https://priceless-galileo-680738.netlify.app).

Our app helps to find and filter restaurants based on different requests.
For example, to find a middle-range Italian restaurant that is open now and also serves lactose-free dishes.

Here are the main features we've developed:

- **Design** from scratch using SCSS.
- Fetching data on restaurants from **API** and rendering it on the home page.
- **Filtering**. We have developed a dropdown panel for filtering of the restaurants based on different categories (cuisine, rating, price level, open? delivery? etc).
- **Search Bar**. When typed in, it filters the listing by name.
- **Dynamic Routing**. When clicked on a Restaurant, a new page with restaurant details opens, the url is updated, accordingly.
- **Redux** store to pass the data between the components.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
